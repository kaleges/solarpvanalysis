    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using Solar PV Analysis ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Solar PV Analysis is a pre-feasibility analysis tool that estimates solar photovoltaic energy production and financial returns based on satellite-derived solar irradiance data (NASA POWER) and user-provided parameters. The App is designed to assist with preliminary solar investment evaluation and is intended as an educational and informational tool.</p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <h2 style="color: #f0a030; margin-top: 0;">3. IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER</h2>
        <p>SOLAR PV ANALYSIS IS A PRE-FEASIBILITY ESTIMATION TOOL ONLY.</p>
        <p>The results provided by this application are approximate estimates intended to support preliminary evaluation of solar PV investments. They should NOT be used as the sole basis for any investment, financial, or engineering decision.</p>
        <p>This tool does NOT replace professional solar site assessments, detailed engineering studies, or qualified financial advice. We strongly recommend consulting with certified solar energy professionals and financial advisors before making any investment commitment.</p>
        <p>KALE GES ENERJI URETIM LIMITED SIRKETI accepts no responsibility or liability for any investment decisions, financial outcomes, or losses arising from the use of this application.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Accuracy of Results</h2>
    <p>The calculations provided by the App are estimates based on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Historical solar irradiance data from NASA POWER (typical meteorological year)</li>
        <li>Simplified PV production models with assumed system losses</li>
        <li>User-provided financial parameters (system cost, electricity tariff, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Actual solar energy production may vary significantly due to local weather variations, shading, panel quality, installation specifics, inverter efficiency, grid limitations, soiling, snow coverage, and maintenance practices. We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any calculations or estimates provided by the App.</p>

    <h2>5. Not Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>The App does NOT constitute and should NOT be interpreted as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Financial or investment advice</li>
        <li>Engineering or technical consulting</li>
        <li>Legal or tax advice</li>
        <li>A guarantee of solar system performance</li>
        <li>A substitute for professional site assessment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Always consult qualified solar energy professionals, financial advisors, and licensed engineers before making any investment decisions.</p>
